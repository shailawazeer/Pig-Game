# 🎲 Pig Game

A fun and simple dice game for two players built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📖 About The Game

Pig Game is a classic dice game where two players race to reach 100 points first. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points, but there's a catch - if you roll a 1, you lose all your current round points!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Roll Dice**: Click "Roll Dice" to roll a random number (1-6)
2. **Add Points**: If you roll 2-6, points are added to your current score
3. **Hold**: Click "Hold" to add your current score to your total score
4. **Avoid 1**: If you roll a 1, you lose all current points and turn switches
5. **Win**: First player to reach 100 total points wins!

## 🎯 Game Rules

- Players take turns rolling the dice
- Rolling 2-6: Points are added to current score
- Rolling 1: Current score becomes 0 and turn switches to other player
- Hold: Add current score to total score and switch turns
- First to reach 100 points wins the game
